# MartiansOnly

## Project Overiew
In this project we hoped to create an application that displayed our love for things out of this world, while showcasing our knowledge of web development. We divided this project into two major categories UI (How the project looked to the viewer) and back-end (how the project ran). We started the project by dividing the into two groups: Reese and Debbie, to cover all things UI while Michael and John covered the backend. 


## Choosing a UI Framework

We went with Foundation as our primary UI Framework because it provides mobile responsive templates, which would ease the burden in creating the application. Along with a helpful library, foundation operates on a grid system making it easier to manieuver parent/child containers. 

## User story

AS A human being who is cognizant of the world around me
I WANT to flee to a planet on which people have not irreparably destroyed the environment
SO THAT humanity can have a second chance

## Result

We wanted a page that looked and responded like an common airline page. Along with search capabilities and destination options we created pages that allowed users to explore deeper into what their trip to mars would look like with the 7 day forecast. For UI we were thinking that it was a good idea to stick on the darker side of things, almost as if users were in a star wars movie.


We allow users the opprtunity to pull live images from different rovers through our NASA Api. Which is definitly one of my favorite parts of the project. 

## Take-aways

This project was an amazing learning experience. Working with other developers deepened my understanding while challenging my programing skills. The team had it's quirks and everyone programmed pretty differently from one-another but overall I think we as a team showcase a deep understanding and love for programing (hence the fact that we have 5 pages for this one application. ) 

We did face a handful of challenges with group-members abandoning their responsibilities, leaving other members without help or direction, and increased workloads. We learned consistent communication is critical, and that it is important to find times to laugh when programming.
